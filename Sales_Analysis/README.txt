# Sales Analysis

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs **Sales Data Analysis** using Python and common data analysis libraries.

The goal of this project is to explore sales data, extract insights, and answer key business questions by analyzing trends, patterns, and performance metrics.

## 📌 Project Objective

This analysis aims to:
- Understand overall sales performance
- Identify top selling products, categories, or regions
- Reveal patterns across time (e.g., by month, quarter, etc.)
- Visualize trends to support data-driven decisions

## 📂 What’s Inside

- `Sales_Analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis workflow  
  * Data loading and preprocessing  
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  * Visualizations and conclusions

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** — For data handling and manipulation
- **NumPy** — For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — For visualization

## 📈 What You’ll See in the Analysis

Typical steps included in this project are:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handling missing values and correcting formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Summarizing key trends and relationships in the data.

3. **Visual Insights**  
   Bar charts, line plots, and distribution graphs to support insights.

4. **Key Business Insights**  
   For example:
   - Monthly revenue trends
   - Best selling products
   - Sales performance across categories
